        Markus Lang is a bassist from Allentown, New Jersey. He is currently
        pursuing a Post-Baccalaureate Diploma at the Curtis Institute of
        Music; studying with Hal Robinson, and Edgar Meyer; and will
        graduate this Spring. As an orchestral musician, he has performed as
        principal bass with the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, and the New
        Jersey Symphony Orchestra, and as a sub list member with the
        Philadelphia Orchestra. Markus also plays with the Camden-based
        orchestra, Symphony in C, where he holds a section position. He
        graduated from the Juilliard School in 2020, where he studied with
        Albert Laszlo, Joseph Conyers, and Rex Surany.

        Passionate about historical double bass playing, Markus has
        performed extensively with Juilliard 415; the school’s early music
        ensemble. He toured with the group in New Zealand and Scandinavia,
        performing Baroque music on historical instruments. He studied with
        Doug Balliett; professor of baroque bass and violone at the
        Juilliard School.

        Equally interested in contemporary music, Markus focuses on music
        that highlights the many colors the bass has to offer. He spent two
        consecutive summers at the Lucerne Festival Academy; under the baton
        of Riccardo Chailly, he was invited to be a member of the Academy’s
        2019 Alumni Orchestra. He played regularly with Juilliard’s two
        contemporary ensembles, AXIOM, and the New Juilliard Ensemble.
        During the COVID-19 pandemic, Markus was part of an online
        initiative, the Berio Sequenza ZOOMarathon, where he performed the
        Sequenza for Double Bass on live internet broadcast along with 13
        other musicians. He has spent the past several summers performing at
        the Verbier Festival, Music Academy of the West, Domaine Forget, and
        the Wabass Institute.
