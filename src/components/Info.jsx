      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Since 2022, Markus Lang has held the position of Principal Bass at the{" "}
       Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra under
        the baton of Santtu-Matias Rouvali. His musical journey extends beyond
        this role, with invitations to perform as Guest Principal with orchestras
        such as the Royal Stockholm
        Philharmonic and the Oslo Philharmonic.
        Additionally, Markus has served as a substitute list member with the
        Philadelphia Orchestra since 2019.

        Beyond his orchestral engagements, Markus is deeply passionate about
        historical double bass playing. He has collaborated extensively with
        Juilliard 415, the School's primary period-instrument ensemble, touring
        New Zealand and Scandinavia to bring Baroque music to life on historical
        instruments. The ensemble worked with resident and guest artists such as
        Monica Huggett, Nicholas McGegan, Ton Koopman, William Christie,
        Masaaki Suzuki, Jordi Savall, Laurence Equilbey, Harry Bicket, and many
        others, performing a dynamic programming of repertoire from the late
        16th through the early 19th centuries on period instruments. Markus
        delved into the art of baroque bass and violone with the guidance of Doug
        Balliett at the Juilliard School.

        Markus's versatility extends to the realm of contemporary music, where
        he explores compositions that showcase the diverse colors and
        capabilities of the double bass. Back at Juilliard, he regularly
        collaborated with contemporary ensembles, AXIOM, and the New Juilliard
        Ensemble. His dedication to contemporary sounds also led him to spend
        two consecutive summers at the Lucerne Festival Academy. Under the baton
        of Riccardo Chailly, Markus has returned to the Academyâ€™s Alumni
        Orchestra. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Markus participated in the Berio
        Sequenza ZOOMarathon, an online initiative where he performed the
        Sequenza for Double Bass on live internet broadcast alongside 13 other
        musicians. In Gothenburg, he's fortunate to work with
        Barbara Hannigan on new music and innovative
        programming.

        Markus just recently released a performance of Kaija Saariaho's work for
        Double Bass and Electronics, "Folia," on <a href="https://www.gso.se/gsoplay/">GSOPlay</a>,{" "}
        to honor the late composer. Looking ahead, in the Fall of 2024, he will
        perform Tan Dun's "Wolf Totem" Double Bass Concerto with the
        Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra.

        Markus Lang, born into a musical family with an American horn player
        father and Finnish cellist mother, is grateful for the rich musical
        upbringing that took him between the United States and Scandinavia. He
        first found his own passion for music playing electric bass in his
        childhood home in New Jersey. Markus embarked on his double bass journey
        in Philadelphia, where he studied with Mary Javian and Ranaan Meyer. A
        graduate of both the Juilliard
        School and the Curtis Institute of
        Music, Markus studied with Hal Robinson, Albert Laszlo, Joseph
        Conyers, Edgar Meyer, and Rex Surany. He also dedicated several summers
        to prestigious festivals, including the Verbier Festival,{" "}
        Music Academy of the West,{" "}
        Domaine Forget, and the{" "}
        Wabass Institute. Markus has the privilege to play on a
        rare English double bass by George Panormo, generously loaned to him by
        the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra.
